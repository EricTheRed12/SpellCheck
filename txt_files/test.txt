I am using this file to test the functionality of the spell checker
program.

It has several examples of  text to parse through.  It doesn't matter what
the
text says, or really how its formatted; it's meant to break the program so
so it eventually works as intended. Too bad no one will probably ever read
this.  Maybe I'll make it my "journal" as the project grows bigger?

Only god knows and I'm too stubborn to acknowledge him.
